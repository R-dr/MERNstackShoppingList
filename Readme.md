App deployed [here](https://mighty-sierra-55673.herokuapp.com/)

## Purpose
  Since finishing my course with coder academy i noticed that my React skills could use a bit of work and as such i decided to explore the subject further.
  this application has been made so far by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) by Brad travesty owner of the youtube channel Travesty Media
### Intended outcome
- sharpen my React skills by firstly following the tutorial and learning more about how to manipulate and use the React frame work
- gain new skills regarding the MERN stack in both deployment of a MERN stack application
- better understand CSS as it applies to React applications 
- Learn how to use MongoDB as it seems more straight forward to using a ruby on rails API with a react application 

## Further progress 
Once i've finished the tutorial as set by brad travesty i hope to rework this application to use functional components rather than the class based components described in the tutorial and deploy this instead using the logic learned here to re-write my portfolio website and attach a Blog aspect to it using a MongoDB data base
